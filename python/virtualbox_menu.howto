Howto:
0. Make sure that VirtualBox is installed properly with also the SDK.
1. Create a launcher in the XFCE panel called "VirtualBox".
2. Adjust the path in the script that the python bindings will be found. Sorry, I did not find a better way to fix that.
3. Run the script. It will look for a launcher with the name "VirtualBox" and append new entries for each machine.
4. Log off from XFCE.
5. Copy the created file launcher-XXX.rc.new into launcher-XXX.rc.
6. Log into XFCE again.
7. Enjoy!
